Hello! I am a novice when it comes to programming in Python, so feel free to give me tips on how to make my project better.
The project is a Dungeon RPG, and a work in progress.
I'm trying to put everything I can into JSON files, so that the project stays as clean as possible.
I have not, as of this moment, been able to find any good info on how I should write these or even on how to bring them into the main.py file.
If you have any tips, please feel free to let me know.

PS. Sorry for the mess in the file.
