Hello! I am a novice when it comes to programming in Python, so feel free to give me tips on how to make my project better.
The project is a Dungeon RPG, and a work in progress.
I'm trying to keep as much as possible out of the main.py file, so that the project can stay as clean and organized as possible.
If you have any tips, please feel free to let me know.

PS. Sorry for the mess which is probably going to appear sooner or later.
